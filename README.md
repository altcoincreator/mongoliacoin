# mongoliacoin
Mongolia, together with the crypto market are catalyst for growth. Profits from cryptocoin assets are significant with ROI opportunity for the risk aware at a rate not available elsewhere. Coupled with this, we find Mongolia to be an emerging market that will benefit from the rigour that crypto contracts can instil and generate progressive ROI on projects. Our ICO brings a unique amalgamation of the two.
Far from being just a new coin or interesting technology, MongoliaCoin seeks to bring about tangible change in the marketplace, helping business entrepreneurs fulfil their potential and crypto investors to share in ROI from both coin and underlying platform appreciation.
MongoliaCoin seeks to solve a number of existing issues and this create huge opportunity for all involved:
•	Mongolia is a land of opportunity with companies controlling significant natural assets, export opportunities and human capital. However the financial rigor is often lacking thus making it very difficult to gain support to grow. Where such is available, it is not at commercially viable rates due to a high risk premium. As a result, businesses with sound underlying growth opportunities are currently severely restricted.
•	Many export opportunities are missed due to a lack of strategic vision. Businesses could grow at significant rates with the benefit of guidance supporting investment. They are also missed due to an inability to put together import/export contracts effectively.
•	A lack of trust exists due to historical lack of transparency. The lack of trust has resulted in businesses going it alone rather than partnering and growing.
•	Funding from investment banks has significant benefits for their shareholders but decisions are made by a few individuals rather than a true collaboration between shareholders and businesses who would benefit from support.
•	Speed of decision making is slow due to the lack of understanding as to what is needed to generate and maintain growth.
•	There is also a lack of an established platform for cryptocurrency that is robust, reliable and scalable and that can accept initial fiat conversion rather than solely cryptocoins.
All of the above have thus presented barriers to growth and restricted the opportunity to benefit from a share in the rewards of growth from those not currently acutely aware of the country and its operation.

The launch site is www.mongoliacoin.co
